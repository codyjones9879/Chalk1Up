          <h1>About Us</h1>
          <p>We're a group of climbers who wanted a way to track and share our climbs, 
            both in the gym and outside. There are a few other tools like us out there, but
            they all seem to be focused on outdoor, or have an outdated interface. Thanks to
            our day jobs, we're a bunch of gym rats who like to get outside when we can. As
            we've moved to different ends of the country, we've found that Chalk1Up is the
            easiest way to stay up to date on each other's climbing. We hope you enjoy our product!
