          <h1>Chalk Bags</h1>
          <p>
            We specialize in hand-sewn <b>boulder buckets</b> ("chalk
            pots", "chalk buckets", etc) with custom designs for each order.
            Our bags are, unfortunately, on hold for the time
            being while Cat (who makes the bags) is busy with nursing school.
            In the meant-time, feel free to drool over our <a
              href="./gallery.php">gallery of previous bags.</a> You are also
              welcome to <a href="./orderabag.php">place a request</a> for a
              bag. Once we return to making bags (it could be a year or more),
              orders will be completed in the order we receive requests.
          </p>
